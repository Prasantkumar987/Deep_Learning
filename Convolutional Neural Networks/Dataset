In Convolutional Neural Network, we use Image dataset which is generally very large taken to improve Classification.
The Dataset, I am using for this project is also very large of about 300 MBs. You can refer to the same data using the link https://www.kaggle.com/prasantdixit/cat-dog-cnn/data to build your convolutional model.
