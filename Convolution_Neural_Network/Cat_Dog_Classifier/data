In Convolutional Neural Network, we use Image dataset which is generally very large taken to improve Classification.
The Dataset, I am using for this project is also very large of about 300 MBs. You can refer to the same data by clicking [I'm an inline-style link](https://www.google.com) to build your convolutional model.
